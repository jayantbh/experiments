# Experiments
A collection of random experimental ideas I come up with, showcased together in a Gatsby project.

This basic project implements the following in the setup:
- Dynamic navigation based on TS _pages_.
- Redux in SSR + Dev-tools.
- Hooks, everywhere. Even for Redux.
- Unit testing with Jest.
- Component generation with [Terrace.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terrace.js).

If you want a basic project starter that has redux with SSR configured to use hooks, and dynamic navigation based on pages, then this is a good starting point with very little bloat.
